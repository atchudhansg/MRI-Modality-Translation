# MRI-Modality-Translation
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to translate MRI images from one modality (e.g., FLAIR) to another (e.g., T1). It incorporates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model interpretability. The code is implemented in PyTorch, focused on medical image translation with an emphasis on transparency and explainability.
